   =============================================================================

1. Facebook:

   + Current implementation doesn't make consume the Facebook Insights API.

     problem or limitation with the current implementation of the Facebook Module.

     $UpdatedCampaign = $(Update-DataSet $campaign -with $FBTimeLine -using $MappingRules) -ne $null
