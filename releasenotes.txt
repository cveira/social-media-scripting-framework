B. KNOWN ISSUES:
   =============================================================================

1. Facebook:

   + Current implementation doesn't make consume the Facebook Insights API.
   + Prospect list is known to be accurate though incomplete. It seems to be a
     problem or limitation with the current implementation of the Facebook Module.

2. Data Sets:

   + The Update-DataSet command add an additional $null object as the first element
     of the object collection that creats as its output. The source of this problem
     is still under research.

     $UpdatedCampaign = Update-DataSet $campaign -with $FBTimeLine -using $FBMappingRules

     WORKAROUND:

     $UpdatedCampaign = $(Update-DataSet $campaign -with $FBTimeLine -using $MappingRules) -ne $null

3. General:

   + Current Libraries don't work reliably under a PowerShell Module. However, they do
     work perfectly fine as standalone functions under the context of the 'Social Media
     Scripting Console'. The source of this problem is still under research.
