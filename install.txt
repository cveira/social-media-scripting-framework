   me know under which ones work and which raise problems.

C. IMPORTING MODULE INTO CURRENT SESSION:

   If you have installed the framework in %HOMEPATH%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SMSF, PowerShell will automatically detect module.

   To import module into current PS session run command:

   If you wish SMSF module to import automatically open/create %HOMEPATH%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 and insert line:

   Import-Module SMSF -DisableNameChecking


D. OPENING THE SOCIAL MEDIA SCRIPTING CONSOLE: (OPTIONAL)
   =============================================================================

   If you have installed the framework in 'C:\SMSF', run the following commands from a PowerShell
   console:

     PS C:\> cd SMSF
     PS C:\SMSF> .\SMSC.ps1


E. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   =============================================================================

There are certain files and folders that should be protected from unauthorized
access because they contain or might contain sensitive information. Those
objects are:

     - .\SMSF-security.ps1

General Windows Security Hardening techniques apply depending, of course, on
your particular case. Nevertheless, there are some big security measures that
you can try:

  1. Set up ACLs in NTFS accordingly.

  2. Set up NTFS auditing accordingly.

  3. Set up Monitoring and Alerts on the Windows Security Events that
     correspond to your auditing settings.

  4. Consider using file system encryption if appropriate under your environmental conditions.

  5. DELETE files containing sensitive information with a Secure File Wiping utility.
